# Project-1---College-Recruitment-Improvement-Study

Purpose of Study:
This project's purpose is to preform data analysis on survey data from CCM. The survey provides data on the students who attended CCM and their "background" with their reason as to why they were influenced to join CCM. The goal is to provide an anaylsis to help the Computing department gain more enrollments. We are taskedd to use python to anaylze the data and create graphs to answer data driven questions. This quiestions will help the admission office in gaining a new perspective and giving them an idea on how to gain more computing enrollments. 

Questions: (I decided to use in my study)
What are the top factors in students' decisions for enrollment (2020 vs 2024)?
What sources are most effective in making students aware and enroll in computing at CCM?
How did the interest level (1-5) of taking more computing classes differ from the year 2020 and 2024?

Files:
2020-Cleaned.csv: Cleaned CSV file containing the 2020 data used in both my parts 2 and 3 for graphing and analyzing data
2024-Cleaned.csv: Cleaned CSV file containing the 2024 data used in both my parts 2 and 3 for graphing and analyzing data
2020.csv: Normal CSV File, uncleaned data for the 2020 data. Altered and modified this CSV in order to make clean CSV files for the corresponding years.
2024.csv: Normal CSV File, uncleaned data for the 2024 data. Altered and modified this CSV in order to make clean CSV files for the corresponding years.
Project#1_Part2 (1).ipynb: Part 2 and Part 3 of my project, where my CSV is cleaned with pandas, and I used the  cleaned CSV with matplotlib to graph my findings and answered my questions for the project
